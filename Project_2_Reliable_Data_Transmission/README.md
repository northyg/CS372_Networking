Project 2 - Reliable Data Transmission (RDT)
Nov 2, 2020

In this coding project we started with skeleton code for an RDT layer that allows the
transfer of string data through an unreliable channel in a simulated environment. Code
for the unreliable channel, the Segment class, and also the calling main function, is
provided. Essentially we had to build out and fill out missing functionality in the code.
