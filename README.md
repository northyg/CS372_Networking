* Project 1 Sockets and HTTP

Introduction:

Project 1 is an introduction to using the Python socket API to get files from a server, and interact
with a web browser client on a local server. My project used Python version 3.7, however I
anticipate it would run with other versions of Python3. This project was written on a Windows
machine, and ran the local server on a Firefox browser.

Instructions:

1. Run the program by using Python version 3.7 and the following file name in a CLI.
Output will be visible in the CLI:
  
  * 1a. Part 1 connect_socket_proj1_part_1.py
  * 1b. Part 2 large_file_proj1_part_2.py
  * 1c. Part 3 http_server_project1_part_3.py
    * i. Connect to local host at 127.0.0.1:1025 on your web browser
    * ii. May need to refresh Browser window, then view output in CLI
    
2. Example of the run command in a Windows terminal:
  * 2a. py -3.7 connect_socket_proj1_part_1.py
